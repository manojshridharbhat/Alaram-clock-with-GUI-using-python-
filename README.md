# Alaram-clock-with-GUI-using-python-
This is a simple program for alarm clock using python. Python then combined  with TKinter to create a GUI application.
The objective of our project is to implement an alarm clock using Python. Python 
consists of some very innovative libraries such as datetime and tkinter which help
to build the project using the current date and time as well as to provide a user 
interface to set the alarm according to the requirement in 24-hour format.
